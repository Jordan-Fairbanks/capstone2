# capstone2
This repository is for my capstone 2 NLP project for Galvanize's Data Science Intensive bootcamp. My project focuses on the [Consumer Complaints dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/shashwatwork/consume-complaints-dataset-fo-nlp). I attempted to build various categorical classifier models and discuss methods for improving performance.
